# LinearRegression
To demonstrate how linear regression in Sklearn and using functions give the same results. 
This project focuses on implementing a linear regression model using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy,
Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Linear regression is a fundamental statistical modeling technique used to establish 
relationships between dependent and independent variables.
